Naive Bayes Classifier Implementation

File Structure:
readme.txt
NB_Project2.py


Development Environment:
Naive Bayes Classifier Implementation for the document classification was implemented in Python 2.7 which has Numpy, Scipy Installed.  

Usage:
My python program is NOT compatible with Python 3.x, and I have not checked compatibility with any other versions. To run my program, please change the path file in the program to give input for training and testing files. When you run the program, you'll be able to see the program printing Count values, Confusion_Matrix and the accuracy for the classification.  
To change the path of the files for the test and training data, please do it in the lines from 12 to 16. Also, please change the file path in the line 23 to read the training label. My program reads both the file at the same time and gives you the output. Each method, what I have defined, has the comments posted before the start of the method, kindly read through that. And, if you have any questions please write it to the above specified mail id. 

Output:
print the confusion matrix(you can see that in the report)
Accuracy : 78.4%

File Structure:
readme.txt
NB_Project2_Method.py

Development Environment: It's the same as above

Usage: 
My python program is NOT compatible with Python 3.x and I have not checked compatibility with any other versions. As mentioned above please change the path to read the files, change the path from lines 12 to 16. Each method, what I have defined, has the comments posted before the start of the method, kindly read through that. And, if you have any questions please write it to the above specified mail id. 

Output:
Shape of the word (6497,)
Words will be printed. Attached the txt file in the report for the Question 6. Please refer that.
